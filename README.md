The import of used libraries, reading the datasets, cleaning, column dropping and most of the functionalities of the code are within the dp.py python script.
We used the globally included script within the project_file.ipynb notebook where the development of the project is being present.

In case of errors when importing libraries, due to the their absence from your systems or from your environment, the solution is to install each one that is needed by using the pip install command in the terminal.
